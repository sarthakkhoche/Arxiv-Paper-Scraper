# Arxiv Paper Scraper

A simple python based script to get recent papers from [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/ "Arxiv's Homepage"), for different subdomains in computer science.

## Working

First, create a folder `papers` in the same directory as the script. Then run the following command :

`python3 scraper.py`

Then, enter the keyword for that subdomain[Refer Below]. Once the script returns "Done!", check the folder for the most recent 25 papers in that subdomain.
